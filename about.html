                <span>Important</span> questions in researches
              </h1>
              <div class="block-text__text">In 2021, a report was released, asking questions like: How much time do we
                have left? In which stage we are now? To
                begin with, we need to understand what to compare (the strating point) and what global warming actually
                is. Global
                warming is the increase in temperature across the ENTIRE planet Earth. Scientists of the world agreed to
                use the
                beginning of the industrial era (1850-1900) as the starting point.
                Stable warming of the Earth began in 1950, and now, only 70 years later, the Earth has warmed in 1.1°.
                On the graph,
                it's clear that we didnt had such a rapid warming in thousands of years. Many "armchair experts" might
                wonder how such a
                small individual can make more CO2 than some huge HUGE volcano. However, scientists in their researchers
                that humans are
                responsible for the temperature increase. Due to climate change, we can feel such an experience like
                heatwaves in
                Israel. Enormous wildfires also occur in the world. For example, the well-known wildfires in Canada,
                United States and
                Turkey. Heatwaves are even recorded as a cause of death.

                how often these <span>heatwaves</span> will appear.
              </h2>
              <div class="block-text__text">
                The UN research also raised the question of how often these heatwaves will appear. They took the
                heatwaves of the last
                50 years as the data base. If in the past, there was 1 heatwave every 50 years, now the number has
                reached 5, and the
                temperature of these extreme weather has also risen. If the Earth's temperature continues to rise,
                heatwaves will become
                more dangerous. For instance, if the Earth warms rise in 4 degrees, heatwaves will occur 40 times more
                often, resulting
                in a hellish situation on Earth. In addition to heatwaves, the increasing temperature of the Earth leads
                to more
                dangerous droughts and floods. But the most important question is: How much time do we have left? This
                "how much"
                depends not on time but on carbon dioxide emissions, in other words, CO2. In the last 200 years, humans
                have been
                responsible for releasing over 2.2 trillion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Our next "milestone" is
                1.5°. At this
                stage, scientists introduce the concept of a "carbon budget," and based on it, we have about 400 billion
                tons left. At
                our current production pace, we have around 10 years left to adapt to new climate conditions. The graph
                shows forecasts
                for the increase in Earth's temperature, ranging from super optimistic to maximally pessimistic. The
                blue graph
                represents the most optimistic scenario if the entire world unites to "address this common problem".
                It's evident that
                we will see a decline by 2030, but we will still reach 1.5° by 2100. The worst-case scenario is depicted
                in the red
                graph. If we continue as now and before, we will heat the Earth by more than 4°. As I said before, this
                would be hellish
                on the Earth

                  Using nuclear energy will help reduce CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels like coal in power
                  plants. Nuclear energy
                  is currently a safe choice. In Russia, 11 nuclear plants make 20% of their energy. We should consider
                  this option more.
